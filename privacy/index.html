    <h1>Heart Points Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Tim, the creator of Heart Points. Your privacy is of utmost importance to me, so I want to be clear that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Heart Points does not directly collect any data about you or your use of the app. That includes this page!</li>
      <li>If enabled, Apple shares some analytics (such as crash data) with me. I do not share this data with any third party. You can opt-out in <strong>Settings &rsaquo; Privacy &rsaquo; Analytics</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:heartpoints@timgthomas.com">heartpoints@timgthomas.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Happy gaming!</p>
    <p>Cheers,<br>Tim</p>
